<p ><h3 style="color:blue;" "font-family: sans-serif;">Community Reinvestment Act (CRA)</h3></p>
<p style="font-family: sans-serif;">  The Community Reinvestment Act was created to encourage banks and other financial institutions to meet the credit needs of their entire community, including low and moderate individuals, small businesses, and small farms consistent with safe and sound banking practices. CRA is designed to encourage banks to help rebuild and revitalize communities through sound lending and good business judgment that benefits the banks and the communities they serve.<br><br>

Further, CRA provides a framework for depository institutions and community organizations to work together to promote the availability of credit and other banking services in low- and moderate-income communities and for low- and moderate-income individuals. CRA has encouraged banks to open new branches, provide expanded services, and make a variety of community development loans and investments. In addition, CRA has encouraged banks to provide substantial commitments to state and local governments and community development organizations to increase lending to underserved segments of local economies and populations.<br><br>

<p ><h3 style="color:blue;"  "font-family: sans-serif;">Serving Our Communities</h3></p>
<p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Supporting our communities has been part of how we define our company since the 1800's, when a lone bookkeeper, Charles Q. Harris, single-handedly kept our bank open to serve customers and distribute relief funds during the Yellow Fever epidemic in Memphis. Today we reflect that tradition through our employee volunteer program, encouraging employees to strengthen our communities by donating time, talent and professional expertise to nonprofit organizations. We offer employees leadership grants and matching gifts through our company's Foundation to further reward organizations they are involved with.
