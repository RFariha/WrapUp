	<p style="font-family:sans-serif;">At WrapUPayment, we understand the importance of a strong community and we are committed to meeting the financial needs of the communities we serve across our footprint.<br><br>

In 2018, we announced our commitment to invest nearly $4 billion to broaden access to financial resources in underserved and low- to- moderate income communities in the Southeast region of the United States. The investment is designed to strengthen community, economic and small business development.<br><br>

Our commitment includes mortgage and small business lending, community development lending and investments, philanthropy, and spending with minority-owned suppliers and marketing firms. It also includes innovative methods to increase the convenience and physical access to financial services in low- to moderate-income communities.<br><br>
</p>

<p style="font-family:sans-serif;"><b>The five-year commitment includes the following priorities and targets:</b></p>
